# Comparing-ML-model-with-Linear-Regression-model 

The data source for the project is Kaggle.com a dataset provider and a dataset search engine.
The data includes 8 columns and is recorded has a hourly record timestep.
The model phased work towards forecasting the change in number of bike usage in the city of London.
The model includes 3 independent variable after certain data manipulation and visualization as specified in the python workbook.
The forecasted dependent variable values with respect to the original values are provided in the excel sheet (.xlsx) .
The second attempt of forecast is by creating a artificial Machine learning model by using same parameters, shape, datapoints, used during Linear Regression analysis 
The forecasted_error for Linear regression model is seem to be substantially low than the Machine Learning prediction.
