# Comparing-ML-model-with-Linear-Regression-model
The dataset used for the project is downloaded from Kaggle dataset website.
In this project the aim was to compare how the results of prediction done by a Machine learning model i.e neural network and a Linear Regression model differ from each other.
The model emphasizes on the error produced by both the models after prediction.
